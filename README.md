# user-friendly-navigation

Overview

While browsing different websites fpr aptitude preparation, I came across [LearnTheta](https://www.learntheta.com/), which had an interesting way of organizing aptitude topics. It inspired me to create a simple, user-friendly topic navigation component that can be useful for blogs, educational sites, or any knowledge base platform.

This component allows users to switch between different sections (like Math, Logic, Verbal) and subtopics dynamically using JavaScript. It's lightweight, easy to integrate, and doesn't require any external libraries.

Features

- Dropdown-based selection for categories and topics
- Dynamically updates available topics based on selected category
- Simple JavaScript implementation
- Fully responsive design
- Can be used for educational sites, tutorial platforms, and more
